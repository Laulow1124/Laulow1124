**Profile Description:** <br>

I'm a Data Science enthusiast with a background in Mechanical Engineering and several years of experience in the aerospace industry. <br>
I recently graduated with a **Diploma in Data Science**, which has equipped me with the technical skills and tools to complement my engineering background and industry experience.

My interest in data science began during my time in aerospace, where I saw firsthand how powerful data can be in driving insights and decisions across engineering, maintenance, and design processes. <br>

For example:

- Engine performance and health monitoring relied heavily on trend data (e.g., temperature, pressure, and speed readings) to detect anomalies and predict potential failures—often well before they happened.

- Reliability metrics like Mean Time Between Removals (MTBR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) which helped uncover root causes of recurring issues, whether they stemmed from design, manufacturing, or operational procedures.

These experiences made it clear to me that data isn't just numbers—it's a tool that can uncover insights, improve performance, and drive innovation. That's what led me to pursue Data Science more deeply.

Currently, I'm building skills in:

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
 
I'm excited to apply my domain expertise and growing technical toolkit to solve real-world problems through data.
